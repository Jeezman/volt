# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security issues, send an email to zero1729@protonmail.com (not for support) with the following in the title `"Volt vulnerability disclosure: {brief_description}"`, replace `{brief_description}` with a short description of the issue (e.g. `Volt vulnerability disclosure: broken Base58 encoding`).

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to the maintainer(s):

| Name | Fingerprint |
|------|-------------|
| Abubakar Nur Khalil | DD35 5DF7 ED1A 0C24 6FE7  D136 C8EB 702A AB8E 2F8D |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individualâ€™s fingerprint: `gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.
